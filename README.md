# DailyChallenge

As part of my moonshot (inspired by the book Think like a Rocket Scientist) 
started writing python code for around 30 minutes every day starting Aug 2022.

### Note: This is like a sportsperson or athlete doing a warm-up, not an intense training session. So don't expect very complex problems in daily challenges. You might even find a lot of similar problems solved again and again.

## Aug 2022

The focus for Aug 2022 was to solve fundamental logical problems.

## Sep 2022

From fundamental logical problems, I increased the complexity level.

## Oct 2022

The focus for Oct 2022 was pythonic solutions like list comprehensions etc.,
To have detailed comments. Apply PEP8
## Nov 2022

Have unit tests. On Nov 10 got the idea of using OOP along with unit tests.

## Plan for Dec 2022

Include exceptional handling.
