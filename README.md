# Daily Python Exercises 

As part of my moonshot (inspired by the book Think like a Rocket Scientist) 
started writing python code for around 30 minutes every day starting Aug 2022.

_Objective 1: This is like a sportsperson or athlete doing a warm-up, not an intense training session. 
So don't expect very complex problems in daily challenges. You might even find a lot of similar problems solved again and again._

_Objective 2 : Once the 30 minutes time block is over, I get up and walk away from it. 
The objective is not solving challenge but coding for 30 minutes every day._

_Objective 3 : This session is not to learn a new topic but to practise known areas. 
In case a challenge needs new learning, I attempt to learn in 30 minutes. If not, I park it for next day._
